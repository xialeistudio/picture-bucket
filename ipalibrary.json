Measure PAR / PPFD, lux, fc, and kelvin: All within the most accurate light meter app out there.\nSetting up your plants’ optimal lighting is not easy, if not impossible without a proper PAR / PPFD plant light meter. Calculating your indoor garden’s daily light integral (DLI) to match your plants’ needs allows you to optimize your lighting for maximal yield at minimal electricity consumption.\nOur Photone grow light meter app measures photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as PPFD in µmol/m²/s, calculates the daily light integral (DLI) in mol/m²/d, and measures illuminance in foot-candles or Lux. It also allows you to measure light temperature in Kelvin which can help you determine if a light is suitable for fruiting and flowering or for vegetative growth.\nPhotone is by far the most accurate light meter app for plants and achieves industrial grade accuracy that easily compares to dedicated and very expensive quantum PAR sensors. You can learn more on how we achieve ±5% accuracy compared to research grade laboratory equipment and how to achieve maximum accuracy by yourself in our white paper: https://growlightmeter.com/whitepaper/\nThe Photone app also contains useful guiding articles to help you get the most out of your plant lighting. In addition, you can find more informative and educational content on our blog: https://growlightmeter.com/blog/\nWondering how much light your plants need? The plant lighting calculator on our website helps you to dial in your lighting to your specific plants’ needs: https://growlightmeter.com/calculator/\nTo receive an accurate PAR and thus DLI measurement, you need to select the correct light source that you are measuring. Some common light sources are already available for free while others may need to be purchased additionally. In this way, we are able to fund our development efforts and offer the most accurate light meter app out there without annoying ads.",

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality.\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n– Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n– Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser…): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n– Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater…\n– For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n– Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n– Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note:\n– you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n– the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n– no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n– The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n– The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n– you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation.",

                    "description": "UTM is a full featured system emulator and virtual machine host for iOS and macOS. It is based off of QEMU. In short, it allows you to run Windows, Linux, and more on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad.\nFeatures\n\n\nFull system emulation (MMU, devices, etc) using QEMU\n30+ processors supported including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V\nVGA graphics mode using SPICE and QXL\nText terminal mode\nUSB devices\nJIT based acceleration using QEMU TCG\nFrontend designed from scratch for macOS 11 and iOS 11+ using the latest and greatest APIs\nCreate, manage, run VMs directly from your device\n\n\nAdditional macOS Features\n\n\nHardware accelerated virtualization using Hypervisor.framework and QEMU\nBoot macOS guests with Virtualization.framework on macOS 12+\n\n\nUTM SE\nUTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see “Install” for more details).\nUTM SE (“slow edition”) uses a\nthreaded interpreter\nwhich performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what\niSH\ndoes for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.\nTo optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).\nHow to install UTM?\nUTM works on all devices running iOS 11 or higher if jailbroken. UTM can also be run\nsemi-tethered\non non-jailbroken devices. UTM runs untethered on some non-jailbroken devices with limited compatibility depending on your iOS version and device processor. See the list below for more details.\n\nNon-Jailbroken Devices\nIf you are running iOS 11, 12, or 13\n: UTM does not require a jailbreak to use, but you must sideload it. If you are new to sideloading, it is a way to use a developer’s certificate to load unapproved apps on a non-jailbroken iOS device. There are a few limitations to sideloading:\n\n\nFree developer accounts must re-sign every 7 days\nPaid developer accounts must re-sign every 1 year\n\n\nThe recommended way for non-jailbreak users is to use\nAltStore\nwhich manages re-signing automatically.\nIf you are running iOS 14.2, 14.3\n: UTM works with sideloading (non-jailbroken) if your device has an Apple A12 chip or newer. Otherwise, keep reading.\nIf you are running iOS 14.0, 14.1, 14.4, or higher\n: UTM works if you are jailbroken or\nsemi-tethered with Jitterbug\nor AltJIT. “Semi-tethered” means either tethered to a Mac/PC, to another iOS device with Wifi sharing, or to itself (one iOS device running both Jitterbug/AltJIT and UTM) through a on-device VPN profile.\n\nAltStore Repository\nNote: at this time, 3rd party repos require a beta of AltStore which is available only to the developer’s Patreon supporters. When installing from the repository, you can recieve update prompts from AltStore.\n\n\nInstall\nAltStore\nAdd the source:\nhttps://alt.getutm.app\nDownload UTM from AltStore\n\n\nAltStore Sideloading\nFor non beta-testers, the public release of AltStore lacks the ability to add repositories and check updates but can still manage re-signing automatically.\n\n\nInstall\nAltStore\nDownload the\nlatest IPA release\non your device\nOpen the IPA with AltStore\n\n\nOther Methods\nThere are many “cloud” signing services including AppCake that do\nnot\nwork with UTM because they use the wrong kind of signing certificate. If you get a crash or a black screen while trying to start a VM, it is likely that your signing certificate was invalid.\nYou can check if you have the right signing certificate by going to\nSettings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management\n. If the certificate used for signing UTM is listed under\nDeveloper App\n, then it is good. If it is listed under anything else such as\nEnterprise App\n, then it is the wrong certificate.\n\n\nJailbroken Devices\nUTM requires AppSync Unified which can be found on\nKaren’s Repo\n. You need to add both repositories to your package manager (Cydia, Sileo, Zebra, etc.) to install UTM.\n\n\nAdd\nhttps://cydia.akemi.ai/\nfor AppSync Unified.\nAdd\nhttps://cydia.getutm.app/\nfor UTM.",

Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water.\n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an acdevelopering live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn’t just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n– DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n– Live Photos\n– Metal Graphics Acceleration\n– Tripod Detection\n– Siri & Shortcuts\n– AI Stabilization\n– Machine Learning & CoreML\n– Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 13. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.",

Apollo reconstructs a 3D map of your photo which you can augment with new light sources in real time. Take your portrait mode photographs from awesome to unforgettable by selecting the color, intensity, distance of a light and illuminate your photos and selfies to your heart’s content.\n\n***\nWARNING: Taking portrait mode photos requires iPhone 7 Plus, 8 Plus, X or NEWER.\n***\n\nApollo is the first app to use the depth data of your portrait mode photos to calculate photorealistic light and shadow. Using a proprietary processing algorithm running on your iPhone’s graphics card, Apollo is able to render light sources on a portrait scene or selfie in real time.\n\nApollo allows professional photographers and amateurs alike to try things that are not possible in the physical world. You can shape scene lighting by adding or even removing light. Since lights are computationally rendered in the scene, it is possible to put a light source within the frame: say hello to invisible lamps!\n\nThe UI is optimised for use with one thumb, allowing you to always view the entire photo. One price, no in-app purchases and no subscriptions.\n\nWe hope that Apollo is part of the computational photography revolution. We are doing our best but your support is crucial. Send us your feedback, ideas or bug reports on our support email.\n\nShow off your lighting chops on our social media outlets.",

But that won’t stop a badge from appearing on your Settings app at some point after your device learns that it has a pending software update.\n\nIn the past, users would install a tvOS profile on their iPhone or iPad to jam the over-the-air (OTA) software update mechanism on their iPhone or iPad so that it wouldn’t see any pending software updates. Consequently, this would also prevent the Settings app from displaying an annoying red badge to remind you of it every single day.\n\nBut now that we have the enhanced\nMacDirtyCow\nexploit at our disposal, using the tvOS profile is no longer a necessary means of hiding OTA updates. That’s because the new\nKillMyOTA\nadd-on by iOS developer\n@haxi0sm\n for the MacDirtyCow exploit works in exactly the same way for iOS 15.0-16.1.2 devices.\n\nOne important note here is that\n@zhuowei\n’s latest MacDirtyCow exploit code providessideloadedapps with unsandboxed perms, which means there’s a sense of persistence. This means that even after a device reboot, you won’t need to re-run the app to turn the OTA blocking effect back on. In fact, re-running the app would revert your OTA blocking and allow the device to see pending software updates.\n\nAs some have pointed out in the\n/r/jailbreak\nrelease post\n, this actually makes KillMyOTA better than using a tvOS profile because the latter can actually expire. So if you forget to renew the tvOS profile post-expiration, then you would end up with a pending software update. KillMyOTA doesn’t expire, so it lasts however long you want it to.\nUsing KillMyOTA doesn’t require a jailbreak, so it’s a great way to continue staying on the lowest possible firmware for your device while waiting for one to launch. Additionally, you maintain your MacDirtyCow bug susceptibility, which means you can continue installing compatible apps in the meantime – a win/win for users in this boat.",

The color page has an incredible range of primary and secondary color grading features including PowerWindows™, qualifiers, 3D trackers, advanced HDR grading tools and more!\n\nBlackmagic Cloud Collaboration\nDaVinci Resolve for iPad supports the revolutionary Blackmagic Cloud, a whole new way of collaborating using cloud based workflows.

You can make characters stand out in an under lit shot, or invert the person mask and stylize the background. Smart reframe repurposes footage to dramatically different aspect ratios by recognizing the action in a scene and panning within it so you can quickly create square or vertical versions for posting to social media. Voice isolation lets you easily remove loud, undesirable sounds from interviews and dialogue recordings from noisy locations. AI tools create quick, accurate results saving you hours of time!\n\nCompatibility\nRecommended for use with Apple iPad Pro M1 or newer models.

Just import your song, tweak some parameters and export a high quality video to be shared.\nThe app currently has 12 themes (more themes and features are coming in future updates), each theme with a set of tweakable parameters for customization, like text strings, sizes, colours, images and how audio waveforms/audio visualizations should react to the music.\n\nMost parameters can be automated in a visual timeline.\nHow to use:\nThe video can be previewed by interacting with the timeline and play/stop button (right under the preview window).\nBeneath the timeline are the selected theme’s parameters. This view is scrollable.\n\nAt the bottom there’s a tab bar:\n\n• Theme\nOpens up a view with available themes\n\n• Music\nLet’s you import music from iTunes or AudioShare (if installed)\nMusic can also be imported from other apps, using the ”Open In..” function. AIF, WAV, MP3, AAC are supported file formats.\n\n• Settings\n• Video Export Quality\nLOW renders a low resolution video on export\nMID renders a 720p video on export\nHIGH renders a 1080p video on export\n• Background Zoom, set this to off if you want to disable background images zooming in and out.\n•Default transition\nTime to fade Images and Colours utilizing the timeline feature.\n• Transition curve, choose between linear, ease in, ease out and ease in and out (S-curve)\n• Fade In / Fade Out\nIf turned on, the video will fade in and out in the beginning and end.

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the “Create Video” button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you’ve seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you’re missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n•Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere’s how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you’re a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you.",

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.”— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither.\n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused, Be present!\n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 90 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt’s never to late to build up productive habits!\n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store.

It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\nBelow you’ll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo.\n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\nIf you think that “getting past the mesh netting” is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time.

The precision is matching with real SPL devices\n– Apple Watch support: see noise level right from your wrist\n– Health App integration: export noise levels directly into Health app\n– Frequency weighting filters: ITU-R 468, A, B, C, Z\n– Powerful, smart history data management:\n+ Recording data can be saved into a list of history records for future access and analysis\n+ Each record can be exported as hi-res PNG graph or CSV text via sharing services\n+ iCloud support which synchronize all history records across your Apple devices\n+ Fullscreen mode to give overview the whole history of an record\n– Dosimeter with NIOSH, OSHA standards\n– Powerful calibration: Linear, Octave 1/1, 1/3, Load/save profile\n– FFT and BAR graphs to display real time FFT. Those are very useful for frequency analysis and musical tests. Real time predominant frequency is also displayed.\n– InstaDecibel to capture your dB report overlaid on photos and easily shared via popular social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Messages, etc.).\n– Support Live Activity, Dynamic Island\n– Support both Portrait and Landscape layouts\n– Beautiful, intuitive and carefully crafted UI design. Themes: LIGHT, DARK and CLASSIC\nOTHER GREAT FEATURES:\n– Standard time weightings (Response Time): SLOW (500 milliseconds), FAST (200 milliseconds) AND IMPULSE (50 milliseconds)\n– MIC Gain Offset from -50 dB to 50 dB\n– Standard measurement range from 30 dBA up to 130 dBA\n– HISTO graph for plotted history of the recorded values\n– WAVE graph with 2 display modes: Rolling & Buffer\n– SPECTROGRAPH\n– Real time scale level chart\n– Display Current, Average/Leq, and Max values with both nice and clear digital and analog layouts\n– Quick reference text to help you compare with real-life examples\nNOTES:\n– Please do not expect a quiet room reading will be 0 dBA. The range 30-130 dBA is the standard usable range and an average quiet room will be about 30 dBA.\n– Although all devices are pre-calibrated, custom calibration is suggested for serious purposes requiring higher precision and accuracy. You will need a real external device or calibrated sound meter as a reference, then adjust the trimming calibration until the reading matches with the reference.",

We did something cool.\nApplying advanced computational photography and artificial intelligence algorithms, ReLens can instantly turn your phone into a professional DSLR camera.\nWith its powerful DSLR-grade large aperture that creates background bokeh and its professional 4K Ultra HD camera, ReLens camera makes it easy to capture “DSLR-like” and “cinematic” shots.\nReLens is designed to be a professional camera app for mobile photography enthusiasts and to help everyone enjoy the fun of photography easily.\n\n# Excellent features\n● F1.4 large aperture with background bokeh effect, say goodbye to simple and dull Gaussian Blur. Essential for portrait mode photography.\n● Reproduction of several classic SLR lenses, such as 50mm 1.4 fixed focal length lens, M35mm f/1.4 “the King of Bokeh”, and Burnside 35, the Swirly bokeh effect lens.\n● AI recalculates the depth of field and adds realistic camera bokeh effects.\n● Various professional lens optical effects such as eclipse, Smooth Trans Focus, out-of-focus reflex, out-of-focus rotation, radiation, color shift, etc. give you a realistic lens experience.\n● Simulation of shutter blade shapes, over twenty realistic camera bokeh shapes such as the pentagram, hexagon, Octagon, heart, etc.\n● Reproduction of the unique spots, textures, and light effects of classic lenses.\n● AI HDR brightness algorithm brings your scrap photos to life. Unlike traditional photo brightness enhancement, ReLens fixes photos with less noise and an even distribution of brightness.\n● AI analyses the photo scene and applies 5 different brightness fix modes: ultra-low light mode, slightly low light mode, normal low light mode, normal light mode, and backlight mode.\n● Intelligent partitioning for you to adjust different depth-of-field layers. You can tone the foreground or background or the sky without impacting the rest of the image.\n● More specialized color toning tools, such as Posterization, Curves, and HSL.\n● Freely modify the depth of field information of the image with the depth brush.\n\n# All-Purpose Professional Camera\n● iPhone front and rear 20x magnification and a 136mm telephoto lens comparable to a DSLR.\n● Manual control of Exposure, Shutter, ISO, Focus, and White Balance.\n● Support 4K and 4K MAX video recording (up to 60 FPS). High-quality video recording with up to 120 Mbps encoding rate. Enjoy Promovie filming.\n● 20x digital zoom to look further than the original camera.\n● Support for Single Autofocus (AF-S) and Continuous Autofocus (AF-C).\n● Supports iPhone, iPad, and all other devices.\n● Professional aids: horizontal lines, grid lines, exposure zebra stripes, etc.\nMore features are coming soon.\n\n# Multiple Classic Camera Lenses\n● Burnside is inspired by the Lensbaby Burnside 35, creating a bubble-like swirling bokeh. It requires a central composition, and a heavily textured background separated from the subject to get this effect.\n● Petzval is inspired by Lomography’s Petzval 55mm F1.7 Mark II. This historic lens is best known for the beautiful large swirling bubble bokeh around its focus and it becomes a favorite of most “hipster” photographers as the year pass.\n● Sigma was inspired by the doughnut blur produced by the Sigma MF 600 mm, creating a dreamy image. Sometimes these doughnuts are distracting from your focus.\n● Sony STF is inspired by Sony FE 100mm f/2.8 STF GM OSS, delivering both smooth blur and fine sharpness with rounded out-of-focus highlights in both the foreground and background blur.\n\nMore camera lenses are coming soon. Stay tuned!!\nDownload ReLens and enjoy weekly updated resources.",

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using “Anki” in their name that have sprung up recently – they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile’s features include:\n\n– A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n– The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you’re about to forget it.\n– A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n– Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n– Support for large card decks – even 100,000+ cards.\n– If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n– A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as ‘tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words’, and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n– Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n– Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple’s Volume Purchase Program.",

Add or remove keys or rows, customize the way keys look and behave, change the duration until subkeys (the keys that pop up when holding on a key) pop up, add and remove subkeys and add keys with custom actions.\nMyKeyboard is beloved by its users for its ease of use and endless possibilities. For example, the emoji row is a standard feature of the custom Keyboard and can be changed to contain all of your favorite emoji. These emoji keys then automatically contain subkeys with similar emoji which you can personalize. By default, a number row is also in the keyboard, providing you fast access to these often-used keys.\nAnother amazing feature of MyKeyboard is the switchable fonts. MyKeyboard contains 19 amazing fonts that can be used across almost all apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and iMessage. You can add a font key to your keyboard and switch to the font by tapping on it.\nCustom key actions include:\n– Insert Appearance\n– Insert\n– Replace Word With Appearance\n– Show Subkeys\n– Shift\n– Caps Lock\n– Cut\n– Copy\n– Paste\n– Accept Correction\n– Dismiss Correction\n– Learn Current Word\n– Switch Keyboard\n– Switch To Main Keyboard\n– Hide Keyboard\n– Next Input Mode\n– Delete Last Character\n– Activate Deletion Mode\n– Clear\n– Clear Left\n– Clear Left Word\n– Clear Right\n– Clear Right Word\n– Clear Word\n– Switch to Emoji Board (Switches you to the emoji keyboard; Learn more about this when you google emoji keyboard)\nThese actions can be triggered on tap and hold. When no hold action is set for a specific key, the keyboard goes into trackpad mode, allowing you to shift the insertion point around by swiping. The deletion mode is similar and allows you to delete by swiping left and retract from it by swiping right. By default, it is the hold/press action on the delete key. You can also increase or decrease the key hold time until these actions are triggered, but you will have to perform swift key gestures when setting it very low.\n~~ Keyboard Builder ~~\nUse the keyboard builder for creating a fully customized keyboard layout in less than a minute. Your own keyboard layout is called “My Keyboard” and can be configured in every imaginable way. You can even add a copy, cut or paste key, a font key, an emoji key, a move cursor key, a “delete all” key and so much more. You can also create your own keys, for example for inserting copypasta or using copy/paste keys to perform these actions faster.\nWe have made keyboard customization very accessible and it’s easily doable for everyone. And it is customizable in every extend. For example, by adding a lot of g keys to a keyboard you could essentially create your own g board, or by adding multiple font switching keys to one, you can create your own font keyboard.\n~~ Themes ~~\nYou can choose from a variety of free and paid themes, or go ahead and create your own customized keyboard theme.\nTheme customization can be used to change every aspect of your keyboard: background and foreground colors, shadow and border sizes and their colors, key corner radius and you can even set a custom height for your keys! Even a custom keyboard background image is configurable with your own photo. In the section “my themes”, you can see and manage all of your customized themes.\nThemes can even be shared with your friends who also use MyKeyboard!",

Because some people do not care about this, there is a development build now available under Releases.\nThe wifi and deep sleep bugs mentioned below have already been fixed in upstream commits, although the solution for the deep sleep is to just kill oobPCI after we have spawned jailbreakd and handed off the primitives to it and the solution for the wifi bug still requires disabling wifi during the jailbreak (can be reenabled afterwards).\nFugu15\nFugu15 is a semi-untethered permasigned jailbreak for iOS 15.\n\nIt contains a code-signing bypass, kernel exploit, kernel PAC bypass and PPL bypass.\n\nAdditionally, it can be installed via Safari, i.e. a computer is not required, except for a Web Server that hosts Fugu15.\n\nPlease note that Fugu15 does not support tweaks (no tweak injection library).\nTested Devices and iOS Versions\n\n\niPhone Xs Max: iOS 15.4.1\niPhone 11 (SRD): iOS 15.4.1\niPhone 12 (SRD): iOS 15.4.1\niPhone 12 Pro Max: iOS 15.4.1\niPhone 13: iOS 15.1 (offline edition – see bugs below [WiFi bug])\n\n\nOther devices are probably supported as well.\n\nNon-arm64e devices are not supported.",

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 35,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.",

With our multi award-winning app, it’s easy: retrieve any anatomical structure and relevant clinical information in an instant. Search through 1000s of anatomical structures such as ligaments, tendons, arteries, veins, organs, and glossary items. Browse by system layers including skin, skeletal, connective tissue, muscular, circulatory, digestive, reproductive, lymphatic, respiratory, urinary and more…\n“User Interface: This is really what separates this app from the rest. Easy and high resolution zooming and movement. Navigating the body couldn’t be easier. Of all the anatomy apps I’ve seen this is definitely one of the best.” *****\n“Thinking of you: All the anatomy apps have the blue dots with information, but with Pocket Anatomy you can click on a muscle and it will give you origin, insertion, key relations, functions (actions), nerve and blood supply, and clinical perspectives” *****\nWhy? The following unique combination of features makes Pocket Anatomy the superior Anatomy and Physiology product in the marketplace (Please note: a subscription is needed to access the app content.)\n1. INTUITIVE SEARCH\nConfusion is easy when it comes to anatomy terms. With our intuitive search option it will suffice to type in only the first characters of the word you are looking for, or one of the words composing the main term. E.g. If you type in “trap” you will get “trapezoid” as well as “coracoclavicular-trapezoid ligament”. The more letters you type the more refined the search.\n2. INTUITIVE NAVIGATION\nFly around the male and female human body by swiping your finger on the screen, fluidly navigating from the skin layer through the superficial to deep musculature, and on through to internal organ structures, ligaments and the skeletal system.\n3. RICH CONTENT\nPocket Anatomy includes full 3D male and female anatomy as well as detailed stand alone visual information on circulatory, connective tissue, digestive, integumentary, lymphatic, muscular, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal and urinary systems.\n4. CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nAnatomical structures in each layer are pinned for identification. Each pin is associated with additional concise relevant information and clinical notes.\n5. GREAT STUDY TOOL\nStudying for your next Anatomy and Physiology exam? Add your notes next to a pin, bookmark the content you are interested in and retrieve it every time you need it. Test your knowledge with your classmates or challenge yourself with our quizzes.\n6. YOU’RE IN GOOD developer\n***** “This BEAUTIFUL app offers mobile medical education for students.”\n~ Apple iTunesU\n***** “EXCELLENT visuals and seamless 3D navigation”\n~ MedGadget\n***** “Renders the old text-book pretty close to obsolete” ~ CNET",

If you have a qualifying subscription, just log in with your Adobe ID. If you don’t, try it with a 30-day free trial. Photoshop on the iPad opens the same files as Photoshop on your desktop (macOS or Windows) using cloud technology, so you can stay in sync across all your devices. Import your raw images directly into Photoshop, make nondestructive edits, and share for comments right within the app.\n\nTOP FEATURES\nPhotoshop on the iPad delivers core tools designed for Apple Pencil and touch. Get inspired and learn tips and tricks in our new inspiration gallery. Our guided tours and coach marks will help you get familiar with the UI, which has been designed for touch and the power of the Apple Pencil. Easily share with collaborators for commenting. We’re releasing new product features every month, so check out the “What’s new” page in the app to see what’s coming next, suggest features, and help us build the Photoshop experience you want.\n\nRETOUCHING AND COMPOSITING:\nEnhance images and adjust color tones with Curves. Remove unwanted elements with the Spot Healing Brush, Healing Brush, and Clone Stamp tools. Bring in your raw photos from your camera, iPhone 13 Pro (ProRaw), or Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, edit them with the power of Photoshop, and send them back to your Lightroom catalog. Use the Object Selection and Select Subject tools to make quick and detailed selections when you’re combining images and fine-tune them with the Refine Edge Brush. Convert layers into Smart Objects that you can transform in a nondestructive way.\n\nPAINTERLY EFFECTS:\nBlur the lines and soften distinct edges with the Smudge tool, which simulates the effects of painting with a wet paintbrush. Smudge, mix, and blend to create an original masterpiece. The Sponge tool gives you full control to adjust the color saturation precisely where it’s needed. Intensify or remove color from selected areas in a single brushstroke.\n\nTOUCH AND APPLE PENCIL CONTROLS:\nSwipe, pinch, tap, scribble, slide — you’ll feel closer to your work than ever before, and with Apple Pencil, you have ultimate precision.\n\nFAMILIAR TOOLS:\nWork with your layer stack and toolbar tools just like on your desktop. With context-aware UI, only the core tools and panes are displayed, so you can focus on your canvas, not the clutter.\n\nFULL PSDS:\nCreate on your iPad with the Photoshop features you know and love, from retouching and compositing to spot healing and blend modes. Layers? They’re all here. Resolution? No difference. Your PSDs are exactly the same, whether you’re working on a desktop, laptop, or iPad.\n\nANYWHERE ACCESS:\nIt’s simple to keep your PSDs in sync across devices. Simplify reviews by sharing for comments right within Photoshop.

It began with the tipping of the food-chain, which forced the humans to establish an outpost and begin an investigation in the region where the first species of mutated plants was discovered. The military has prepared a vast number of powerful weapons, with you leading the vanguard forces to wage this long war.\n\nSubverted Order\n“Many years later, when the humans watch as the plants climb up to the top of the food chain, they will be reminded of their own naivety and arrogance…”\nOnly when all the plants started to evolve into animals, growing limbs and becoming sentient, did the humans realize the threat of those photosynthetic-lifeforms. No one knows how they achieved the state of evolution that took animal lifeforms millions of years to reach in such a short amount of time, and no one knows their ultimate objective. The only thing known for sure is that the humans now face the greatest challenge since they climbed up to the top of the food chain.\n\nGameplay\nAs the first explorers of this unknown region, you must strive to venture deep into the enemy hive, defeat all kinds of fruits and arm yourself with various equipment, as well as upgrade yourself with the resources you find in your way.\n\nGame Features\n-Rougelite elements such as random terrains, loot drops, and monsters\n-Hundreds of special and bizarre weapons and items\n-Loads of unique mod enemies and bosses\n-10 characters in the roster with unique skills and abilities\n-Unique artstyle with rich details",

Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep.\n\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\n\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes:\n\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\n\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\n\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\n\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!",

                    "description": "“Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel “Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land. Those creatures that have encountered the mythical power of the fragments inherited unprecedented power. In doing so, this newfound strength kindled their heart’s innermost wickedness, turning them into horrifying monsters. With a world in chaos, a master and his three disciples accept Guan Yin’s decree and set out to reunite the fragments into a new scripture.\nThe game follows the journey of a master and his three disciples as they fight, solve puzzles, collect loot, parkour, platform and more on their mystical demon-slaying adventure. You must capitalize on their special attacks and holy relics in a battle of wit and bravery against demons to complete their pilgrimage in reuniting the scripture.\nFollowing its release on Steam and consoles, the mobile edition of “Unruly Heroes” is now available!\nHighlights:\nFantastic hand-drawn art style—Rich and in-depth level design illustrates a vivid sense of realism.\nSwitch between the master and disciples—Effortlessly switch between the four characters both in and out of combat to overcome puzzles and obstacles.\nRich and varied gameplay—Over ten different gameplay elements including: fighting, puzzle solving, loot collecting, parkour, platforming and more.\n\nAwards\n“Unruly Heroes” won the 47th Annie Award for best game character animation.",

Use the hills as jumps – slide down, flap your wings and fly! At least for a moment – until this annoying gravity brings you back down to earth. But the next hill is waiting for you already. Watch out for the night and fly as fast as you can. Otherwise flying will only be a dream once again.\n\nTiny Wings was chosen as the iPhone Game of the Year in App Store Rewind 2011 in Europe and many other countries. Thank you Apple and a big thank you to all Tiny Wings fans!\n\nHighlights:\n• simple “one button” (ok… maybe “one tap”) arcade game about the dream of flying\n• the world is changing every day – so it does in this game! Procedural generated graphics will make “tiny wings” look different every day you play\n• Two game modes: “Day Trip” and “Flight School”\n• iPad only: Split screen multiplayer!\n• upgrade your nest by fulfilling tasks\n• Play as the mama bird or one of her four children\n• 30 hand-designed levels in the new “Flight School” mode\n• iCloud support (even syncs your game between the iPhone & iPad versions)",

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\n\nIt’s been two years since This War of Mine global release and we’re still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly – a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about?\n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events\n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter\n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive\n• Make decisions – an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience\n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game\n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game’s theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with “The Little Ones” expansion. “The Little Ones” explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you’ll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children",

Compete for the fastest times against friends and family, stamp your initials on the high-score board for all to see. Seven games with four levels each for 28 separate high-score boards!\nMath Racer is by far the fastest Math Speed Testing App on the App Store. Our simple interface removes all possible barriers between your brain and your reaction time. All times are measured to the hundredth of a second for even more fun.\nWhat users are saying about Math ®:\n• “An app game I actually use” – Kuto\n• “This is an excellent tool I use in my classroom” – Ktoens\n• “This is a really great concept” – MM38866\n• “I love this app” – Asweetswweta\nEach user can enter their own initials like in the arcades to keep track of high-scores and game details like exactly how long each problem took and which problems were missed. All user misses are tracked and organized to highlight areas for improvement.\nWhether you are 99, 3+1 or 36/2 years old, there is a game and a level that will challenge your skills and push you to become faster than you ever thought you could be.\nMath Racer… Race against TIME!\n**************************\nSpecial Note from the Architect:\nI wanted to push the limits of human ability and find out how quickly people can answer 10 or 100 basic math problems if all barriers to that task are removed. Entering 91 on a number pad and pressing enter can take 2 seconds for many people. Writing the number 55 in pencil can take as long as 4 seconds for slower writers because of the strokes involved. Listening to a verbal question and verbalizing the answer 27 can take as long 4 seconds as well because of the four syllables.\nWhen you add up these 2 to 4 second User-Interface delays over 100 problems, they can add 200 to 400 seconds to the total time required. It becomes quickly apparent that Math Tests do not test math calculation, memory or thinking abilities as much as they test handwriting, verbalization or keypad entry skills. We have shown that it is possible for a really fast thinker to answer 1 math problem every .9 seconds using Math Racer. In fact, Math ® is the only app in the app store that measures and records for viewing on the high score board detail view exactly how long it took the user to answer each question in hundredths of a second.\nThe purpose of this game is to even the playing field and test pure math calculation or memory skills alone. Nothing else ever invented for testing math speed even comes close. We think you’ll agree. Please let us know your thoughts. We welcome any and all feedback that will help us make Math Racer even faster.\nThe world record in answering 100 Random Math Problems will likely be set on an iPhone 4 using Math ® in the next 12 months… Maybe YOU will set it!\nThank You.\n-Michael\n**************************",

When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* You can be a goat\n* Get points for wrecking stuff – brag to your friends that you’re the alpha goat\n* MILLIONS OF BUGS!

This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his struggle against the criminal elements of the galaxy.\nThis isn’t your ordinary dual-stick shooter. The emphasis is on tactical combat and stealth, rather than just spraying bullets, and there’s a story!\n\nTACTICAL COMBAT\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge – frag grenades, flash bangs, drones, gun turrets, proximity mines and much more…\n\nSTEALTH\nChoose your approach carefully. Some say running into the fray, guns blazing, isn’t always the answer. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use stealth takedowns and silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers. Hack gun turrets to turn on their masters. Lure different enemy factions together and let them fight each other.\n\nLOAD-OUT & GEAR\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon – and there’s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.\n• Tactical top-down shooter\n• Gorgeous, stylistic HD graphics rendered with Metal\n• 20 missions with performance based rewards. TAMI is watching you!\n• Wide selection of weapons and gear.

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face!\n\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game — unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n– Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\n– Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\n– Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\n– New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\n– Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\n– The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\n\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

The stranger tells you that he woke up in an unfamiliar place. He doesn’t know how he got there. Suffering from a terrible pain in his head, he vaguely recalls that someone just tried to strangle him. White walls, bars on the windows, rooms with numbers on the doors… welcome to Nocton Hill Asylum.\nAn unlit corridor lies ahead – should he go left or right? Your advice will affect how the story unfolds and give you the chance to reach 19 different endings, each revealing more of Robert Houston’s story. And you might just learn something about yourself along the way.\n\n• Richly crafted storyline. You’ll need all your wits to untangle the insane web of this stranger’s nightmares. We promise this story will shock you to your core.\n• Lively, flexible dialogue. You don’t just get a choice of two responses, like you might expect in this genre. You can have three, five or even 10 different actions to choose from – as many as you could want.\n• Real-time dialogue mode. Most of the time, you won’t have to make decisions against the clock, but in moments of peril, dialogue happens in real-time: if you put your phone down, Robert will think you’re ignoring him and he’ll be forced to make the decision on his own.\n• Immersive soundscape. We’ve composed 20 minutes of music for the game, a soundtrack that’s mysterious, strange, unnerving and sometimes downright terrifying. At certain points, dark techno music will add momentum to the unfolding horror. 🙂",

Discover this ever-expanding universe with your friends and family, where you can make and share your own adventures.\nSEVEN WONDERS OF THE GAME\n1 – The Adventures\nAccept the call, and your journey is set: to have fun! Prepare yourself to face a path full of challenges, enemies, puzzles, and platforms. Every time you open the game, a new road of trials stands between you and the heart of adventure. Only the brave will succeed.\n2 – The Creator Mode\nPlaying an adventure is cool, but what would it be like creating your own? You have all you need: Blocks, Characters, and Items. They come with premade behaviors and allow you to create an entire adventure using the same tools and content we use ourselves. See how blocks magically combine into stunning structures. Your finger is all you need to build environments, give life to characters, hide treasures, place enemies, and design combats. Take a chance! Publish your adventure, share it with friends and players around the world. Such creativity might even be featured in the Wonderbox gallery.\n3 – The Boxes\nThese are the core of the game: the carefully-crafted spaces where the adventure flows. Visuals are colorful and often breathtaking. Don’t get too cozy, though, because a quiet sunset box might lead to one with nightfall or sandstorm. From box to box, there is a deep chain of interconnected environments to explore. Each one is unique, like a masterly grown bonsai: small in shape, immense in meaning.\n4 – The Heroes\nChoose the hero you want to be. Customize your character with a vast diversity of possibilities. Earn more as you play and upgrade your collection. Assemble the coolest, the bravest, or even the weirdest hero for your quest. Travel through the boxes, talk to the villagers, cross the portals, beat the enemies, and avoid the hazards. Playing this game is all about exploring, fighting, jumping, and solving.\n5 – The Challenges\nSome boxes are amazing. Others are a maze. Sometimes you need coins to buy the sword to beat the goblin to get the key to open the door to finally escape. A treasure might be hidden under, above, in front of or behind a simple tree. Discover! Rotate the camera to explore each corner of the diorama. And beware: the challenges are limitless, just like the adventures.\n6 – The Party Mode\nExpandable fun! Up to 4 players can form a party and play any adventure together. Call your tribe and cross the threshold. Even a dark dungeon gets brighter when you’re surrounded by well-equipped family and friends.\n7 – The Soundtrack\nBe amused by the chords of Eric Chevalier, the composer of Rayman 2: The Great Escape. Each note of the soundtrack is there for a reason: to build the perfect atmosphere not only to play a game, but to play a hero.",

It may not be the most challenging part, but it is the most essential section in the game since you need to keep advancing through it to unlock further sections of the game.\nOnce you have passed a certain dungeon level, you can unlock “Altar of the Darkness” , “Boss Mode” and “Clock Tower of Challenges”. Those are where the true test of skill and power happens. For our shadow hunters to overcome those challenges, mastering the fighting technique is a must, understanding the characteristics of each demon and preparing a suitable strategy is needed and strengthening the shadow equipment is a huge plus.\nAt the end of the day, shadow hunters can not only liberate the mortal world from those dark demons but also can test their skills and mastery against other fellows of the shadow.\n\nMULTIPLE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AND ROLL\nPlayers will get to play as multiple different characters, each has its own unique skills, gameplay and assets. Each character is going to be a distinct way to play the game, a distinct approach to the strategy and the combat.\n\nKEY FEATURES\nIntense hack and slash combat.\nEpic Boss Fights.\nMultiple characters to play.\nHundreds of equipment and weapons to loot and upgrade.\n4+ PVE modes and PVP.\nPlay anytime, anywhere even when offline.",
