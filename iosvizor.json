If you are one of these, be sure to try Photosynth – it is designed to create spectacular spherical panoramas. The functionality of the application is simple: you scroll the phone, the camera automatically takes pictures, however, if this is not to your liking, you can press the shutter yourself, but as a rule, do not have to do this: the automation does it well itself. The only thing that can prevent: moving vehicles or people – they will have to be avoided. In addition, the application has a powerful social element: the resulting panoramas can be shown to friends in social networks (albeit in the form of a flat image) or used to publish the photosphere with the same service.",

In fact, the application is a kind of emulator of these very tools, and also makes it possible to record voice and has the basic functions of an audio editor. On the start screen, you can select the musical instrument you need (drums, piano and guitar are available by default), adjust it to your needs and start playing by making gestures that simulate playing a real instrument. In order to synchronize the sound with other devices, you can use Bluetooth. The voice for the future composition is recorded separately.\nAfter you have rehearsed the song, you can record it and save it to the iTunes library. Thus, having only a few talented friends with Apple devices and a few hours of free time, you can record a full-fledged track, or just have a good time playing your favorite instrument. GarageBand is completely free, but contains, as mentioned above, a limited selection of tools. You can open the rest for a fee.",

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they’ve ever encountered before!\nNARRATIVE·DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY\nChicken Police is a story·rich and dialogue·heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated.

You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants.\nA CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE\nChicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo·realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film·noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!\nChicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40’s film·noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it’s so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.\nKEY FEATURES\n· A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film·noir twist\n· Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!\n· A carefully crafted, “”colorful”” world\n· A complex interrogation system\n· More than 30 unique, fully voiced characters\n· A cinematic film·noir like experience with more than 20 cutscenes!\n· Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find\n· A beautiful original soundtrack\n· Game Center support\n© HandyGames",

          "description": "Juicy Realm is a roguelike game with fruits as enemies. It is set in a world in which the line between animals and plants is blurred. It began with the tipping of the food-chain, which forced the humans to establish an outpost and begin an investigation in the region where the first species of mutated plants was discovered. The military has prepared a vast number of powerful weapons, with you leading the vanguard forces to wage this long war.\n\nSubverted Order\n“Many years later, when the humans watch as the plants climb up to the top of the food chain, they will be reminded of their own naivety and arrogance…”\nOnly when all the plants started to evolve into animals, growing limbs and becoming sentient, did the humans realize the threat of those photosynthetic-lifeforms. No one knows how they achieved the state of evolution that took animal lifeforms millions of years to reach in such a short amount of time, and no one knows their ultimate objective. The only thing known for sure is that the humans now face the greatest challenge since they climbed up to the top of the food chain.\n\nGameplay\nAs the first explorers of this unknown region, you must strive to venture deep into the enemy hive, defeat all kinds of fruits and arm yourself with various equipment, as well as upgrade yourself with the resources you find in your way.\n\nGame Features\n-Rougelite elements such as random terrains, loot drops, and monsters\n-Hundreds of special and bizarre weapons and items\n-Loads of unique mod enemies and bosses\n-10 characters in the roster with unique skills and abilities\n-Unique artstyle with rich details",

Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown.\n\nIn the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep.\n\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\n\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes:\n\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\n\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\n\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\n\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!",

          "description": "“Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel “Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land.

          "description": "In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\n\nIt’s been two years since This War of Mine global release and we’re still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly – a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about?\n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events\n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter\n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive\n• Make decisions – an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience\n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game\n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game’s theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with “The Little Ones” expansion. “The Little Ones” explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you’ll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children",

Compete for the fastest times against friends and family, stamp your initials on the high-score board for all to see. Seven games with four levels each for 28 separate high-score boards!\nMath Racer is by far the fastest Math Speed Testing App on the App Store. Our simple interface removes all possible barriers between your brain and your reaction time. All times are measured to the hundredth of a second for even more fun.\nWhat users are saying about Math ®:\n• “An app game I actually use” – Kuto\n• “This is an excellent tool I use in my classroom” – Ktoens\n• “This is a really great concept” – MM38866\n• “I love this app” – Asweetswweta\nEach user can enter their own initials like in the arcades to keep track of high-scores and game details like exactly how long each problem took and which problems were missed. All user misses are tracked and organized to highlight areas for improvement.\nWhether you are 99, 3+1 or 36/2 years old, there is a game and a level that will challenge your skills and push you to become faster than you ever thought you could be.\nMath Racer… Race against TIME!\n**************************\nSpecial Note from the Architect:\nI wanted to push the limits of human ability and find out how quickly people can answer 10 or 100 basic math problems if all barriers to that task are removed. Entering 91 on a number pad and pressing enter can take 2 seconds for many people. Writing the number 55 in pencil can take as long as 4 seconds for slower writers because of the strokes involved. Listening to a verbal question and verbalizing the answer 27 can take as long 4 seconds as well because of the four syllables.\nWhen you add up these 2 to 4 second User-Interface delays over 100 problems, they can add 200 to 400 seconds to the total time required. It becomes quickly apparent that Math Tests do not test math calculation, memory or thinking abilities as much as they test handwriting, verbalization or keypad entry skills. We have shown that it is possible for a really fast thinker to answer 1 math problem every .9 seconds using Math Racer. In fact, Math ® is the only app in the app store that measures and records for viewing on the high score board detail view exactly how long it took the user to answer each question in hundredths of a second.\nThe purpose of this game is to even the playing field and test pure math calculation or memory skills alone. Nothing else ever invented for testing math speed even comes close. We think you’ll agree. Please let us know your thoughts. We welcome any and all feedback that will help us make Math Racer even faster.\nThe world record in answering 100 Random Math Problems will likely be set on an iPhone 4 using Math ® in the next 12 months… Maybe YOU will set it!\nThank You.\n-Michael\n**************************",

Guessing the solution to a puzzle should not be an option, you need to think before you can advance to the next room.\nA classical point-and-click adventure game with beautiful 3D-graphics and physics-based puzzles that create a new depth to the puzzle and escape room genre.\n\nBEAUTIFUL 3D\nLegacy 3 – The Hidden relic is a beautiful 3d puzzle game.\n\nCHALLENGING PUZZLES\nWhen encountering a new puzzle, think before clicking. This game will reward you for thinking creatively and I always strive towards making the puzzles seem logical.\n\nPICK UP ITEMS AND TAKE PHOTOS\nThe rooms in Legacy 3 are filled with items and clues that are there to help you on your quest. Interact with amazing touch controls to inspect your newly found keys and tools. If you see something that looks interesting you can use your camera and take a photo – of whatever you like! Trying to remember that instruction you saw ten rooms before? No problem – just use the camera and you don’t have to!\n\nATMOSPHERE\nHuge and natural looking locations designed with simplicity in mind creates a compelling and mysterious atmosphere. If Legacy 2 – The Ancient Curse was a dark game, this is the opposite. The rooms are big and brighter. But that does not make the puzzles easier. And there are still hidden objects that you need to find in order to solve the puzzles.\nWith an inbuilt hint-system you should be able to advance when you get stuck. Some puzzles are more difficult than others and this system should help you get to the next room.",

This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his struggle against the criminal elements of the galaxy.\nThis isn’t your ordinary dual-stick shooter. The emphasis is on tactical combat and stealth, rather than just spraying bullets, and there’s a story!\n\nTACTICAL COMBAT\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge – frag grenades, flash bangs, drones, gun turrets, proximity mines and much more…\n\nSTEALTH\nChoose your approach carefully. Some say running into the fray, guns blazing, isn’t always the answer. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use stealth takedowns and silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers. Hack gun turrets to turn on their masters. Lure different enemy factions together and let them fight each other.\n\nLOAD-OUT & GEAR\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon – and there’s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.\n• Tactical top-down shooter\n• Gorgeous, stylistic HD graphics rendered with Metal\n• 20 missions with performance based rewards. TAMI is watching you!\n• Wide selection of weapons and gear. Over 70 different weapons.\n• Multiple factions to fight – or pitch against each other\n• MFi controller support (requires extended layout)\n• iCloud save game support\n• Game Center achievements\n• English, Deutsch, Français, Español, Italiano, 简体中文, 한국어, 日本語, 繁体中文, русский, Português do Brasil",

          "description": "Nocton Hill is a horror text adventure with 19 different endings.\nYou receive messages from a stranger asking for help. The stranger tells you that he woke up in an unfamiliar place. He doesn’t know how he got there. Suffering from a terrible pain in his head, he vaguely recalls that someone just tried to strangle him. White walls, bars on the windows, rooms with numbers on the doors… welcome to Nocton Hill Asylum.\nAn unlit corridor lies ahead – should he go left or right? Your advice will affect how the story unfolds and give you the chance to reach 19 different endings, each revealing more of Robert Houston’s story. And you might just learn something about yourself along the way.\n\n• Richly crafted storyline. You’ll need all your wits to untangle the insane web of this stranger’s nightmares. We promise this story will shock you to your core.\n• Lively, flexible dialogue. You don’t just get a choice of two responses, like you might expect in this genre. You can have three, five or even 10 different actions to choose from – as many as you could want.\n• Real-time dialogue mode. Most of the time, you won’t have to make decisions against the clock, but in moments of peril, dialogue happens in real-time: if you put your phone down, Robert will think you’re ignoring him and he’ll be forced to make the decision on his own.\n• Immersive soundscape. We’ve composed 20 minutes of music for the game, a soundtrack that’s mysterious, strange, unnerving and sometimes downright terrifying. At certain points, dark techno music will add momentum to the unfolding horror. 🙂",

Discover this ever-expanding universe with your friends and family, where you can make and share your own adventures.\nSEVEN WONDERS OF THE GAME\n1 – The Adventures\nAccept the call, and your journey is set: to have fun! Prepare yourself to face a path full of challenges, enemies, puzzles, and platforms. Every time you open the game, a new road of trials stands between you and the heart of adventure. Only the brave will succeed.\n2 – The Creator Mode\nPlaying an adventure is cool, but what would it be like creating your own? You have all you need: Blocks, Characters, and Items. They come with premade behaviors and allow you to create an entire adventure using the same tools and content we use ourselves. See how blocks magically combine into stunning structures. Your finger is all you need to build environments, give life to characters, hide treasures, place enemies, and design combats. Take a chance! Publish your adventure, share it with friends and players around the world. Such creativity might even be featured in the Wonderbox gallery.\n3 – The Boxes\nThese are the core of the game: the carefully-crafted spaces where the adventure flows. Visuals are colorful and often breathtaking. Don’t get too cozy, though, because a quiet sunset box might lead to one with nightfall or sandstorm. From box to box, there is a deep chain of interconnected environments to explore. Each one is unique, like a masterly grown bonsai: small in shape, immense in meaning.\n4 – The Heroes\nChoose the hero you want to be. Customize your character with a vast diversity of possibilities. Earn more as you play and upgrade your collection. Assemble the coolest, the bravest, or even the weirdest hero for your quest. Travel through the boxes, talk to the villagers, cross the portals, beat the enemies, and avoid the hazards. Playing this game is all about exploring, fighting, jumping, and solving.\n5 – The Challenges\nSome boxes are amazing. Others are a maze. Sometimes you need coins to buy the sword to beat the goblin to get the key to open the door to finally escape. A treasure might be hidden under, above, in front of or behind a simple tree. Discover! Rotate the camera to explore each corner of the diorama. And beware: the challenges are limitless, just like the adventures.\n6 – The Party Mode\nExpandable fun! Up to 4 players can form a party and play any adventure together. Call your tribe and cross the threshold. Even a dark dungeon gets brighter when you’re surrounded by well-equipped family and friends.\n7 – The Soundtrack\nBe amused by the chords of Eric Chevalier, the composer of Rayman 2: The Great Escape. Each note of the soundtrack is there for a reason: to build the perfect atmosphere not only to play a game, but to play a hero.",

It may not be the most challenging part, but it is the most essential section in the game since you need to keep advancing through it to unlock further sections of the game.\nOnce you have passed a certain dungeon level, you can unlock “Altar of the Darkness” , “Boss Mode” and “Clock Tower of Challenges”. Those are where the true test of skill and power happens. For our shadow hunters to overcome those challenges, mastering the fighting technique is a must, understanding the characteristics of each demon and preparing a suitable strategy is needed and strengthening the shadow equipment is a huge plus.\nAt the end of the day, shadow hunters can not only liberate the mortal world from those dark demons but also can test their skills and mastery against other fellows of the shadow.\n\nMULTIPLE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AND ROLL\nPlayers will get to play as multiple different characters, each has its own unique skills, gameplay and assets. Each character is going to be a distinct way to play the game, a distinct approach to the strategy and the combat.\n\nKEY FEATURES\nIntense hack and slash combat.\nEpic Boss Fights.\nMultiple characters to play.\nHundreds of equipment and weapons to loot and upgrade.\n4+ PVE modes and PVP.\nPlay anytime, anywhere even when offline.",
